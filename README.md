## Unacceptable Behavior

### No subtle put-downs or unfriendly language.
Even if you don’t intend it, this can have a negative impact on others.

### No name-calling or personal attacks.
Focus on the content, not the person. This includes terms that feel personal even when they're applied to content (e.g. “lazy”).

### No bigotry.
We don’t tolerate any language likely to offend or alienate people based on race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion — and those are just a few examples. Use stated pronouns (when known). When in doubt, don't use language that might offend or alienate.

### No harassment.
This includes, but isn’t limited to: bullying, intimidation, vulgar language, direct or indirect threats, sexually suggestive remarks, patterns of inappropriate social contact, and sustained disruptions of discussion.


## Our Expectations
* **If you’re here to get help, make it as easy as possible for others to help you.**
Follow our [guidelines](/asking/good-questions.md) and remember that our community is made possible by volunteers.


* **If you’re here to help others, be patient and welcoming.**
Learning how to participate in our community can be hard. Offer support if you see someone struggling or otherwise in need of help.

* **Be clear and constructive when giving feedback, and be open when receiving it.**
Edits, comments, and suggestions are healthy parts of our community.

* **Be inclusive and respectful.**
Avoid sarcasm and be careful with jokes — tone is hard to decipher online. Prefer gender-neutral language when uncertain. If a situation makes it hard to be friendly, stop participating and move on.
